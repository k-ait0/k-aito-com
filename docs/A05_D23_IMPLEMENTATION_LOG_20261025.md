# A05 implementation log — append-only

## 2026-10-25 — A05-D23-001

**Scope:** K. Aito LIFE DESIGN LAB / A05 人生価値観診断

**Before:** D-1–D-22 consisted of in-chat prototypes, design proposals and
unexecuted test harnesses. The repository held a KIDP-003 P0 WANT/MAYBE/PASS
swipe prototype, and its P0 specification explicitly excluded 16-type
classification from P0.

**After (draft feature branch):**
- Add a *separate*, unlinked and noindex/nofollow A05 prototype directory.
- Implement versioned 30-question definitions, alternate left/right
  polarity, exact integer-threshold classification, 16 T-types + auxiliary
  E-axis variants (money/time/neutral/withheld).
- Preserve RGBY order G1 Blue / G2 Green / G3 Red / G4 Yellow.
- Add a standalone static-site interface with question/review/result/catalog/
  history and optional browser-local persistence.
- Add IndexedDB consent, revision conflict handling, atomic finalization,
  raw answer deletion, explicit JSON export and new-A05 data deletion.
- Add snapshot integrity classification (verified/legacy/quarantined).
- Add Node built-in regression script without new dependencies.

**Reason:** Remove duplication between D-16–D-21 sample engines, support
an actual repository-level code review, and keep P0 intact.

**Unchanged:** P0 scope, existing P0 HTML, existing publication routes,
previous design history, public navigation, live production deployment.
No merge or live release is included.

**Verification status:** Implementation draft committed; Node tests, browser
acceptance, accessibility and deploy verification **not yet executed**.
The built-in crypto.subtle hash is used, but real question validity and
measurement properties have not been experimentally established.

**Known exclusions:** Old D-12/D-19 migration, cross-tab UI merge,
live-site integration to A01 / MY LIFE NOTE, character asset production,
analytics and anonymous-response aggregation.

**Next release gate:** Node engine tests pass; local site preflight passes;
real browser verifies consent, saved draft after reload, history integrity,
corrupt/legacy lockdown, export, individual raw purge and deletion; user reviews
the content and approves a separate release PR.
